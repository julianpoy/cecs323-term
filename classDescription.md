## Class Descriptions

### Customer
**Customers** are the primary source of income for Dave's Automotive. Customers own *Vehicles* which require maitainence. A **customer** may be a single person or an entity, such as a buisness. A private individual only has 1 address. An entity may have multiple addresses, for different purposes, such as Billing, Mailing, or Delivery. Dave's has 4 types of categories for customers: *Steady*, *Premier*, *Prospective*, and *Dead Prospect*.

*Steady* customers have signed up for our email and come in for maintenance occasionally. 

*Premier* customers are upgraded steady customers. They have signed up for our annual **preventative maintenance package**. Premier customers bring their vehicle in for regular maintainence for an annual charge and no more. **preventative maintenance packages** are for individual vehicles, not for the customers.

*Prospective* customers are customers referred to us by our *steady* and *premier* customers. When a *prospective* customer is refferred to us, we add them to our collection as a *prospective* customer. We also eep track of who referred them. Our regular customers recieve bonuses for referring us to new customers. Prizes to steady customers are a free oil change. Prizes to *premier* customers are $50 off their next monthly payments. We send ads and coupons to these customers.

*Dead Prospects* are *prospective* customers that haven't become steady or premier customers after 3 attempts at advertising. Dave's tries not to be annoying and doesn't try to contact them further after that.

### Preventative Maintenance Package
A *Premier* customer is a *steady* customer that has upgraded with our **Preventative Maintence Package**. These packages are tied to a vehicle that the customer owns. A customer may have multiple **Preventative Maintence Packages** for multiple vehicles. Customers sign up for a year of preventative maintenance for each vehicle. The price of the package depends on the make/model/mileage of the vehicle. So long as the customer brings in their vehicle for maintence within 2000 miles of their scheduled maintence and does not get into the accident, Dave will not charge them for both regular *maintainence items* and unforseen repairs. There is the caveat that Dave's will not accept this package on vehicles with over 200,000 miles on it, for reasons related to keeping the buisness afloat.

### Vehicle
A vehicle is an automotive mode of transportation that our customers use to travel. These vehicles require regular maintenance to function properly. Dave's Automotive happens to provide these services. Each **Vehicle** has **Maintenance Items** that need to be done at different intervals. When a **Vehicle** is brought into Dave's, we update the mileage and use that information to do the estimated mileage. Each make/model of car has different maintenance requirements and intervals. Dave's reminds the owners of the vehicles when they have upcoming maintenance items. 

### Service Technician
A **service technician** is an employee who interacts with **customers** when they bring their **vehicle** in. Our technicians are primarily responsible for writing up maintenance visit orders. After determining what **Maintenance Items** need to be done for the vehicle, the **Service Technician** then assignes a **Mechanic** to each item. The **Service Technician** also tells our prospective

### Mechanic
A **Mechanic** is a technician that works for Dave's Automotives. Each one has skills that are tracked. **Mechanics** work on **maintainence items** if they have the skill set, however exceptions can be made. Each **mechanic** may tutor other mechanics to teach them other skills. The beginning and end of a mentoring relationship is tracked and there are no limits on repeated mentorships. Each employee has sick/personal days they earn each month. This is tracked individually and updated when needed.

### Maintenance items
A **Maintanence Item** is a single item of maintainence for a vehicle. Examples of these would be: Change Wiper Blades, Replace Struts, or Oil Change. Each item has a price and average work hours, which are related to the vehicle make/model. 

### Maintenance Package
A **Maintainence Package** is a collection of **Maintainence Items**. Typically a vehicle will reccomended **maintance items** be done every certain amount of miles. A package is identified by the mileage, make, and model of a vehicle. Each item has a **mechanic** assigned to it. Vehicles will be assigned maintainence packages corresponding to the make/model and the closest mileage interval.

### Foreign Prices
Dave's Automotive keeps note of the local competitors. Dave's keeps track of the most recent known price for comparable *maintainence items* that other stores offer. 

### Foreign Store
A **Foreign Store** is a local competitor that offers automotive services that could be seen as competition to Dave's Automotives.

### Interns
An **Intern** is an aspiring **Mechanic** that Dave's Automotives has taken under their tutelage. Functionally, a **Intern** is similar to a **mechanic**, except that an **intern** is required to have a mentor. An intern is able to work on **maintainence items** just like a normal mechanic. It is assumed that the mentoring mechanic is nearby to offer advice and instruction when needed.

### Expenses
Each employee, excluding interns, has an expense card that they can use. These are used to make work related purchases on site or take potential clients out to lunch. Each **expense** is tracked and noted. Information you'd want to keep track of is cost, reason, date, notes.
